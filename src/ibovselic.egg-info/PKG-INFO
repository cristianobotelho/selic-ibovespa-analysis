﻿# IBOV x SELIC Explorer

Tools and notebooks used in the monograph "Analise comparativa entre o desempenho do IBOVESPA e a evolucao da taxa SELIC no Brasil (2010-2024)". The repository is now structured as a small Python package plus reproducible notebooks so that anyone can download the datasets and revisit the analysis.

## Highlights
- Clean src-based package (`ibovselic`) with reusable fetchers for IBOVESPA and SELIC time series
- Command line interface (`ibovselic` or `python -m ibovselic.cli`) for exporting JSON datasets in one step
- Editable install with optional extra dependencies for exploratory notebooks and statistical analysis
- Ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks documenting the full workflow together with small sample datasets

## Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.11 or newer is recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install the project in editable mode together with the notebook stack:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[analysis]
   ```
3. Export the raw datasets used throughout the study (adjust years as needed):
   ```bash
   ibovselic --start-year 2010 --end-year 2024
   ```
   The command stores three JSON files under `data/raw/` (`history_ibov.json`, `history_selic.json`, `history_selic_meta.json`).

> Tip: you can also call `python scripts/export_data.py --start-year 2010 --end-year 2024 --verbose` if you prefer to stay within the repository.

```

## Working with the data
- `ibovselic.exporter.MarketDataExporter` exposes high level helpers (`export_ibov`, `export_selic`, `export_selic_meta`) and batches API requests in ten-year chunks to avoid rate limits.
- The Banco Central SGS API and the B3 index statistics API are queried directly; check their official documentation for service limits.
- The package always writes UTF-8 JSON with ISO formatted dates. The resulting files can be loaded straight into pandas or any other tool that understands JSON arrays.

## Notebooks
The original research notebooks remain under `notebooks/`. Each notebook now imports `ibovselic` directly, so activating the virtual environment and running `pip install -e .[analysis]` is enough before launching Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
The first notebook cell handles the path setup and creates the `data/raw/` folder automatically.

## Sample datasets
`data/sample/` contains the three JSON files exported on 2024-10-27. They provide an immediate reference without requiring a fresh download, but you should regenerate them to ensure you are working with the latest information.

## Known limitations
- Network connectivity is required to download fresh data from B3 and the Banco Central.
- Public APIs may introduce throttling or format changes. Error messages from the CLI include enough detail to investigate failures.
- The time series cover 2010-2024 by default; adjust the CLI arguments if you need a different window.
